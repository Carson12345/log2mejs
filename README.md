*Something wrong only at certain devices but you can't read the console of the devices? You can now directly see the error log of any device, without enabling developer mode of the device*

Have you ever experienced this? Your users tell you that your web app doesn't work on their browsers, but the app works perfectly with your devices (usually works on your teammates' devices too), you have a gut feeling that the issue relates to a specific OS version of browser version of the users, all you need is to find a device that can reproduce the same case, but there are always some occasion that you cannot read the console and see what the error is

1. The device could be at the hand of a non-developer friend / user who is not right next you now, you dare not to ask them to do the USB connect + open browser developer tool thing for the troubles and explanation needed
2. The device is yours, but that device is too old / your laptop's USB connect debug function failed for some reason
3. Any other similar scenario

This assistant mainly has one purpose, that is to tell you whats going on at other devices.

it can be easily injected to your web page, inspect the error, and show the error details to you / related people only.
